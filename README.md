# FriendFinder
This app is designed to take in user input and compare that input against a list of possible friends and return the friend with the best compatibility. The home page directs the user to take the survey. The survey page asks for the user's name and a photo, then asks several questions that the user can respond to on a scale from one to five (one equals strongly disagree and five is strongly agree). Based on the user's answers to the survey questions a friend's name and photo will be displayed on screen in a pop-up modal. The friends are saved to a list and each time the survey is submitted the user is added to the list of possible friends for the next user. The npm express package is used to handle the routing for the html and api routes.
